An image, located within /images

![an image alt text](/blog/photos/test.jpg "an image title")

This is some text before the image. We have to decide what we want to do with it and wether it will wrap.  
That's the question. 

![an image alt text](/blog/photos/test.jpg "mouse over"){:class="photoHalf"}

* A bulletted list
- alternative syntax 1
+ alternative syntax 2
  - an indented list item

1. An
2. ordered
3. list

Inline markup styles:

- _italics_
- *italics*
- **bold**
- `code()`

> Blockquote
>> Nested Blockquote

Syntax highlighting can be used with triple backticks, like so:

```javascript
/* Some pointless Javascript */
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
```

Use two trailing spaces  
on the right  
to create linebreak tags  

Finally, horizontal lines
