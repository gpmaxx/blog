This is a test posting from Hyde. This is a [link](http://www.lipscomb.ca). Here is some more text in  order for it to wrap
to the next line. I want to see what an entire paragraph looks like. This should be very intersting to see the spacing and
hopefully I can make things look nice.  

That would be really great if I can get this stupid site looking  proper by the end of today but I'm not holding my breath
because CSS is a real pain in the ass.
