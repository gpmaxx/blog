### About Greg

After completing my computer science degree I had the good fortune to apply the skills I learned working as a volunteer IT teacher trainer for VSO. 
At the age of 24, flying on a plane for the first time I spent 7 months working and living in Muleba, Tanzania.
This experience would open my eyes to the wider world and spark my interest in travel.  
  
Thanks to my experience, some contacts and some great luck, I ended up with a job in the Telecommunication field which allowed me
to travel to and live all around the world.  

Aside from travel I have been recently dabbling with Arudino and hobby electronics. Some Arduino libraries are available via my [GitHub](https://github.com/gpmaxx/){:target="_blank"}

### What's Greg up to?  
  
I am currently travelling for pleasure, backpacking through South East Asia.  

I am also seeking opportunities in IT technical project management globally.  Please see my LinkedIn below and/or contact my by email.  

Some photos, videos and other details of my travels can be found on my social media accounts.   

### About the posts  

One minor note about the posts: Given to the uncertainly with travel and the (often lack of) availability of internet access, all posts are
logged and sorted by the day they were written. This does not necessarily relate to the date and/or order they are posted. I will attempt to post them in order
but it's not 100% certain that the "newest" post which will appear first is actually the newest posting.
