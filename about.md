### About Greg

Hello,  

After completing my computer science degree I had the good fortune to apply the skills I learned working as a volunteer IT teacher trainer for VSO. 
At the age of 24, flying on a plane for the first time I spent 7 months working and living in Muleba, Tanzania.
This experience would open my eyes to the wider world and spark my interest in travel.  
  
Thanks to my expeirence, some contacts and some great luck, I ended up with a job in the Telecommunication field which allowed me
to travel to and live all around the world.  

Aside from travel I have been recently dabling with Arudino and hobby electronics. Some arduino libraries are available via my GitHub. 

### What's Greg up to?  
  
I am currently travelling for pleasure, backpacking through South East Asia.  

I am also seeking oportunities in IT Technical Project managment globally.  Please see my LinkedIn below.  

Some photos, videos and other details of my travels can be found on my social media accounts.
